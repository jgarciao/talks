# Flathub - An app store and build service for flatpak applications

Slides of the talk on Flathub @ramcq and me made at GUADEC 2018

### Abstract:

Since last year's launch, Flathub has become the de facto app store for flatpak applications, with hundreds of available apps and thousands of monthly users.

This talk will provide answers to the following questions:
- What is Flathub? What does it offer users and developers?
- How can I publish a new app/theme/runtime/...?
- How does Flathub work? What is the infrastructure behind it (build service, website...)?
- What plans are there for future development?
- How can I contribute to Flathub?
